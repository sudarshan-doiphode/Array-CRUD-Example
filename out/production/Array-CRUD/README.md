# Array-CRUD-Example
In this repository, I have added basic examples of Declaring an Array, Initializing an Array, Updating an Array and Deleting Particular Element from array

# What is an array ?
1. Array is like container which holds group of elements.
2. Array holds similar type of elements in it.
3. Size of Array is fixed.

# Array Declaration :
_ways to Declare an array :_
1. int[] array = new int[5] ---> array declare with fixed size -->Use scanner to take input
2. int array[] = new int[5] ---> array declare with fixed size
3. int array[] = {1,2,4,5} ---> array with Initialized elements

Note : you can use[] before or after variable. 

# Access Array Elements :
1. To print elements from array we can use loops like for, for each (enhanced for) and while
2. We can also use Arrays.toString() method to print array in array structure.


# Update the element at paricular index: 
1. Take index and value from user and run loop over array and 
check if index is same as user entered index then directly updated element by user entered value
